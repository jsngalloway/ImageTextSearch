Lazy Town Memes 50 mins Stefan Karl deactivated his Twitter account and slowly leaving Facebook now. He asked me to tell ya'll that he will always remember you guys, he loves you and will never let you down but now he's going to focus on trying to extend his life as much as he can and enjoy life with his kids, wife and family. \"Follow your dreams and know that death is nothing, life is everything.\" Sincerely yours, Milena Barshatskaya Art #wearenumberone <3
