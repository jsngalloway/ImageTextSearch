Lazy Town Memes 1. Stefan had a growth removed. 2. Stefan is NOT cured but does NOT have cancer as of now. 3. Stefan STILL needs donations. 4. The cancer could come back randomly. 5. Stefan will most likely need treatments and doctor visits his entire life to help keep the cancer from coming back. 6. Even if you cant donate, creating memes, music, videos, art, etc means the world to him. Hes fighting even harder because he knows we need him. https://www.gofundme.com/2tmgtqk
