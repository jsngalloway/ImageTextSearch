\"Back in the day, I would sometimes dress up like a teenage boy named Tyler and sell my son weed. I would always have to rush home and change back into my mom clothes before my son arrived. I'd scream at him al night for buying weed. Then I would confiscate it and sell it right back to him the next day.\" ILLUSION 100
