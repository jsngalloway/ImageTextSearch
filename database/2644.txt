Hey Bert, it's the anniversary of the night we got pinned down in Vietnam! They were yelling and shooting all around us. You were hugging your rifle, screaming against the hail of bullets until you finally cracked. You took all those ears as trophies! Do you remember that night, Bert? .. I remember that night...
