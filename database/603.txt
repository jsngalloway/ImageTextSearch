Stefankarl @stefanssonkarl t's not until they tell you youre going to die soon that you realize how short life is. Time is the most valuable thing in life because it never comes back. And whether you spend it in the arms of a loved one or alone in a prison-cell, life is what you make of it. Dream big 7:26 PM-09 Mar 18
