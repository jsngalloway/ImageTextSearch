OsD Ross LeBeau of Texas was arrested in early December for possession of what police thought was half a pound of meth in LeBeau's vehicle. The \"meth,\" it turns out, was actually kitty litter LeBeau was using to reduce fog on his windows. I love his mug shot. Definitely a face that says \"I can't wait till you idiots have to apologize to me.\"
