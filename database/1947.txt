ELEMENTARY PTA ALTERNATIVE FUNDRAISER This fundraiser is in lieu of sending students home with the task of selling door-to- door, collecting money and delivering goods. Please help us avoid that by supporting our PTA with your donation, and helping achieve our goals to support our students and faculty. Thank you in advance for your support! $10 I do not want to bake, so here is the money I would have spent on cupcakes $25 I do not want to hit up friends, family and co-workers, so here is the money I would have spent on wrapping paper. $50 I do not want to walk, swim or run in any activity that has the word \"thon\" in it. Here is the money I would have spent on my child's \"FREE\" t-shirt. $100 I really wouldn't have helped anyway, so here is $100 to forget my name. $ Iam making this donation to express my appreciation for having nothing to buy, sell, or do except fill out this form.
