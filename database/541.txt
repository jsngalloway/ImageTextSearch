Elon Musk @elonmusk When I first met Mark, we were at some boring corporate party. Tired of stupid chit-chat and expensive drinks, I pitched an idea to Mark: Each of us would come up with the most fun activity we could imagine, and surprise the other with it. I drove to a nearby lake, ordered two water-powered jetpacks, two paintball guns, and arranged to fly Journey in. I figured that nothing could be more awesome than an airborne paintball duel with \"Don't Stop Believing\" playing in the background. When I came back to see Mark's activity, I found him in a back alley next to a terrified waiter from the party, couldn't have been older than 25. In exchange for paying his student loans, Mark excitedly told me, the man would let us beat him until he stopped moving.
