QUORA QUESTION A compelling question from Q& A site quora.com How can you train yourself to go to sleep quickly like they do in the military? Answer by KENNETH REESE Dad, a nurse and a veteran Wake up at 0430. Immediately go run 2 miles (fast) or jog 4 to 6 miles. Do several hundred push-ups, sit-ups, squat thrusts, pull-ups or jumping jacks and then eat breakfast. March 8 miles with 40 pounds of whatever strapped to your back and then eat lunch. Run 2 more miles, do several hundred repetitions of whatever exercise you fancy. Then eat dinner. Take an hour of down time, and by 'down time' I mean run around trying to get work done. At 2230, lay down. You will fall into the deepest sleep you have ever experienced. By day 2 you will have the ability to fall asleep instantly at any time anywhere.
