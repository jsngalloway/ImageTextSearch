Hey, welcome to my free library! I built this because I think sharing ideas with your neighbors is pretty neat. Take a book or two, enjoy, and, if you remember, bring it back to the library so others can read it. Also feel free to bring some books of your own. Thanks! Sam PS. There's a lady who drives a gold sedan with Georgia tags who has stolen all of the books out of the library several times. If you see her, give her a mean glare for me. If you are that lady... C'mon man
