You Fucked Up(2) Today at 4:57 PM To Cards Against Humanity Store Hey guys And girls don't want to be sexist in the 21st century. Anyways I bought the cards against humanity 5th expansion and I ended up getting the 1st expansion. I deleted my old emails so I don't know if this was an error on my end or yours but I'm going to go the route of blaming all my problems on a stranger over the internet. In all seriousness you guys make one hell of a game and all the little secrets and hidden gems in your products are the reason why I buy all the expansions from you guys. Keep up the good work (besides the dude in charge of shipping me this...you should fire him) and let me know what I should do from here Thanks Robbie Reply, Reply All or Forward | More Cards Against Humanity To Me Today at 5:12 PM Hey Robbie You definitely just ordered the first expansion instead of the fifth. It's fine. You're probably just dumb. We're sending you a free 5th expansion to make up for how dumb you are Cheers, Claire and the CAH team Show message history Reply, Reply All or Forward | More
