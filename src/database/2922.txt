So let me get this straight. You want to be banned from poling places on the day of an election, banned from being able to enter government buildings, prohibited on school grounds, not allowed in a business if an owner doesn't like what you are, put in a locked cage (safe) when you aren't being used, not be allowed in the passenger cabin of an airplane, and be the topic of a never ending National debate about how dangerous you are to the public and innocent people? Did I understand that correctly?
