ooo Verizon LTE O 34961 10:20 PM MC Marco Whats up bro Do you think i have peed 1 million times in my life? Hell nah son Are you fucking dumlb Boili you about to get roasted The average human urinates 6-8 times a day. If you have been doing that since you were born that is 52,560 at the high side of that average. That number resembling nowhere near a million had to have been configured by a dim-witted moron. You would have to be atleast 342 years old peeing 8 times a day to pee a million times or pee 34 times a day and live to 80 Delivered er .. Message O
