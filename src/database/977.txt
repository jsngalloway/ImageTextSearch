o just-shower-thoughts I hate that SEPTember OCTOber NOVember and DECember aren't the 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th months. advanced-procrastination Whoever fucked this up should be stabbed higashikatajoshuu If I recall, they did used to be the corresponding months. It was just when Roman leaders Julius Caesar and Augustus came into power, the months July (Julius) and August(Augustus) were added, thus throwing off the numbering of the calender. gentlemanbones Good news, though: whoever fucked it up did in fact get stabbed.
