# ImageTextSearch
Pulls relevant text out of images such as screencaps which are then added to a searchable database.

Before proceeding further, please install pandas, the scipy extension of numpy, and mpl_toolkits into your Python library.
Then add the external libraries onto the project if working in Eclipse.
