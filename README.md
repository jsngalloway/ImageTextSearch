# Image Text Search
### A project created at the Cypher V Hackathon
###### Jesse Galloway, Isabella Fernandez, Yang Zhang, Reeves Trott

### Overview:
This project takes a list of links to images, extracts all the text found in the image, and allows the user to search the database to find the original image containing that text.

#### Google Cloud Vision
This project leverages Google cloud vision to identify the text in each image.

#### 
Pulls relevant text out of images such as screencaps which are then added to a searchable database.

Before proceeding further, please install pandas, the scipy extension of numpy, and mpl_toolkits into your Python library.
Then add the external libraries onto the project if working in Eclipse.
